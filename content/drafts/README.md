# Drafts

Folder containing drafts of articles written during my [365 Days Of Code](https://dev.to/pjeziorowski/365-days-of-blogging-challenge-or-i-transfer-1000-to-your-bank-account-5dj9) challenge.

The rules of the challenge:

1. Write one article a day (replaced by writing 500 words instead, thanks to [InHuOfficial comment on dev.to](https://dev.to/pjeziorowski/365-days-of-blogging-challenge-or-i-transfer-1000-to-your-bank-account-5dj9) about choosing quality over quantity).
2. Skipping a day == failing the challenge.
3. Failing the challenge == me transferring $1000 to a random person from the comments section from the post above.
