[Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) CEO, Romaric has just started [his own blog on hashnode](https://www.heapstack.sh/). I become jealous, so I started thinking about blogging again. I couldn't decide where to publish my content, though:

- Hashnode?
- Dev.to?
- My.own.site?
- Medium?

To save me some time, I decided to publish everywhere with an automated content pipeline. My goal was to write one markdown file and have my posts
automagically distributed everywhere. In this post, I'll show you how I achieved it - maybe you'll find it helpful on your own blogging adventure!
